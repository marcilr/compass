x Thu Aug 24 15:58:18 AKDT 2017 - Tracked down the "must-have" reference.
  A copy of Volder's The CORDIC Trigonometric Computing Technique online at:
    http://www.jacques-laporte.org/Volder_CORDIC.pdf

  Saved to:
    compass/code/math/cordic/pdf/Volder_CORDIC.pdf

  Cool reference in:

  cordic_refs.html
    References on CORDIC Methods

    The "must-have" reference is the Volder one, it seems to be the original work.
    The Zoran Corporation technical note talks about magnitude and phase computation
    with CORDIC methods, but is probably impossible to find.  Cowan & Grant have a
    section of a chapter on CORDIC methods illustrating several kinds of CORDIC calculations

    Volder, J.E., 1959; The CORDIC Trigonometric Computing Technique, IRE Transactions on
      Electronic Computers, V. EC-8, No. 3, pp. 330-334
