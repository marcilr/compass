CS470 Digital Compass Project


Sun Aug 13 16:48:14 AKDT 2017
=============================
The Digital Compass Prototype was my senior project for the University of
Alaska Anchorage in 2000.  I completed it when I graudated in 2000.

Whilst digital compasses are now readily available at the time this was a
truly great project.

  Need to Purchase
  Almost everything on this page has been purchased already or is not being used
  in the current compass design.  I've left this here because it has a good list
  of part numbers for future reference.
