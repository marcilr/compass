CS470 Digital Compass Project


Sun Aug 13 16:48:14 AKDT 2017
=============================
Found the "Digital Compass Prototype - Raymond Marcil" cdrom on the shelf amongst a 
quadrillion other cdroms.  This was my senior project when I graduated with my degree
in Computer Science from the University of Alaska Anchorage in 2000.

I've been meaning to look at this for awhile.  Whilst digital compasses are now
readily available from REI and Cabela's for the time this was a great project.

  Need to Purchase
  Almost everything on this page has been purchased already or is not being used in the
  current compass design.  I've left this here because it has a good list of part numbers
  for future reference.
