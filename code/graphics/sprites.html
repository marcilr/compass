    <h1>Graphics Routines - Sprites and Bitmaps</h1>
    The compass monitor uses sprites to store and display bitmaps.  Sprites are used to display
    alpha-numeric characters as well as special graphics. This page only has the theory behind my
    implementation. If your'd like to see the actually 8052 assembly code please click 
    <A HREF="../raymon">here,</A> and see the latest revision of raymon.asm for
    the LCD and graphics routines. <BR><BR>
    
    Sprites are a rectangular set of pixels that make up a 
    bitmap or part of an image. Sprites are defined by width and height, and the bits that 
    make up the sprite.  Following is an example 5x9 sprite for a '2':<BR><BR>

    Since the display I'm using has only two bit setting ON and OFF, each pixel can be represented 
    by a binary 1 or 0.  The sprite can thus be encoded as a set of 1's and 0's (see graphic).
    I needed to decide on an appropriate memory storage format. 
    I decided to use the standard format that everybody else uses which is 
    <b>linear sprite format</b>.  This format uses a linear array in which the first character
    of the array stores the sprite's width and the second character stores the sprites height.
    After these first two bytes the sprites bits are stored as a one dimensional array.<BR><BR>
    The conversion from a two-dimensional structure to a linear array is intuitive. You 
    start with the first row (row number zero) and then concatenate the second row to its end. 
    You then concatenate the third row to the end of the list, then the fourth row, etc.  
    Actually you can either contenate the rows (row-majored) or concatentate the columns (column-majored).
    With the orientation I've writing to the LCD the row index (actually the column idex) is auto-incremented 
    so to optimize writing to the display I opted to use row-majored arrays.

    To store the data in program the linear arrow of bits must be broken into a word size
    appropriate for the microcontroller which in the case of the 8051 is am 8-bit byte. The
    graphic below shows how the linear array of bits is broken into 8-bit bytes and converted
    to an array of decimal digits.  It should be noted the at 40 bits that comprises this
    sprite nicely divide by 8 to make 5 bytes.  If an odd number of bits is encountered the
    end of the array should be padded of 0's to the next multiple of eight, ie 8,16,24,32,...8*n<BR>

    Each graphic and character to be used requires its own sprite stored in memory. Using
    5x7 pixel characters, the entire ASCII character set can be represented using 5*128=640 bytes.
    Writing sprites to the display requires writing out the rows of the bitmap.
    The bits offset of any individual row is easily calculated using:

     <tr><td valign=top>
<PRE>
<B>offset=row*row_length</B>    

Where: <B>row</B> is the offset to calculate, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 in this case.
       <B>row_length</B> is the lengh of each row, in this case 5.
</PRE>  

     </td></tr>
   </table>

    <P>
    Dividing the bit offset by 8 yields the first byte in the array in stored memory with that row's bits, handily the remainder
    of this division is the number of left rotates to bring the start of the row into alignment.  It must be remembered
    that a row may be longer than 8 bits so it may be necessary to read multiple bytes from stored memory.

    <P>     
       Writing data to the 64x100 pixel display was conceptually simple but the implementation was
       not easy. There were several complications that made writing the code difficult.  First the 
       <A HREF="../../parts/lcd">LM4064</A> word size is 8-bits, so writes to the LCD display must be 
       one word (byte) at a time. For setting/clearing individual pixels this means the appropriate 
       word must be read from the display, the appropriate bit updated, then written back to the display. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Writing sprites or bitmaps to the display faces the same problems as setting pixels. 
      I wanted the ability to place sprites anywhere in 
      the x,y plane, not just on word boundaries. The example on the right shows the problem.  Notice that the 10x18 
      graphic of a digit '2' spans two display pages. Notice that the 3 pixels to the right and left of the graphic need to 
      be preserved when the sprite is written to the display.
      To accomplish this I had to read the bytes 
      from the display that will be overwritten, mask out the appropriate sections, logically OR the new data to 
      be written, then write the data back to the display.  Since the display is entirely memory-mapped this 
      can actually be done fairly quickly.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      I spent nearly two weeks implementing the routines to write sprites to the display.
      This code was frustrating to write due to the stored memory and display alignment problems which require 
      many bit munipulations. However, it is also some of the most satisfying code because 
      I can now write graphics with ease and see the results immediately.
