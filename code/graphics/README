  Graphics Routines - Bresenham's Line and Circle Algorithms
  In addition to routines for setting individual pixels, and bitmaps to the display I also
  needed routines to write lines and circles to the display for the compass needle.  A little
  research revealed that one of the best methods to use is Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm.
  "Brensenham's line-drawing algorithm (and its derivatives) is one of the most commonly used
  algorithms today for describing a line on a raster device.  The algorithm was first published
  in Bresenham's 1965 article Algorithm for Computer Control of a Digital Plotter It is now
  widely used in graphics and electronic printing systems.

  Graphics Routines
  This section contains all the algorithms, assembly code, and reasoning behind
  the graphics routines for the digital compass display.  Given that the primary
  objective of the digital compass is to display a real-time representation of a
  compass bearing this is an area where I dedicated a lot of development time.

  Graphics Routines - Drawing the Needle
  With all the graphics primitives (putpixel, line, circle, sprite, etc.) written 
  the next step was to draw the actual compass needle.  A lot of different methods
  presented themselves for drawing the needle to the display. My first idea was to
  create a bitmap of the compass needle then rotate all the individual points in
  the bitmap to the correct orientation then write the new bitmap to the screen.
  Given that the current needle is 47 pixels high and 13 pixels wide this would
  mean 47x23=1081 rotation calculations each time the compass needle is drawn.
  I decided this was too computationally expensive so I looked for a more efficient
  way to draw the needle.
