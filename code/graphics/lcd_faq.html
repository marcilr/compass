<hr>
Since the introduction, rapid decline in price, and increased 
availability of notebook computers capable of
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs--MacOS and
Windows),  there has been an increased interest in flat
panel display technology.  A notebook/palmtop computer 
requires a light weight, durable, and reliable display.  
Liquid Crystal Display technology has met these requirements 
and as a result, virtually all notebook computers are equipped 
with some form of LCD.  This FAQ is intended to address the 
general confusion concerning LCDs that has arisen recently by 
explaining the technology, operation, and characteristics of 
this important display device.

<h2>LCD FAQ Part I: Liquid Crystal Display Fundamentals</h2>

<strong>1.0 General Characteristics and LCD Modes</strong><p>

    Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are categorized as non-
emissive display devices, in that respect, they do not produce 
any form of light like a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT).  LCDs either 
pass or block light that is reflected from an external light 
source or provided by a back/side lighting system.  There are 
two modes of operation for LCDs during the absence of an 
electric field (applied Power); a mode describes the 
transmittance state of the liquid crystal elements.  Normal 
White mode: the display is white or clear and allows light to 
pass through and Normal Black Mode: the display is dark and 
all light is diffused. Virtually all displays in production 
for PC/Workstation use are normal white mode to optimize 
contrast and speed.<p>

<strong>1.1 LCD Cell Switching and Fundamentals</strong><p>

    A simplified description of how a dot matrix LCD display 
works is as follows: A twisted nematic (TN) LC display 
consists of two polarizers, two pieces of glass, some form of 
switching element or electrode to define pixels, and driver 
Integrated Circuits (ICs) to address the rows and columns of 
pixels.  To define a pixel (or subpixel element for a color 
display), a rectangle is constructed out of Indium Tin Oxide 
-- a semi-transparent metal oxide (ITO) and charge is applied 
to this area in order to change the orientation of the LC 
material ( change from a white pixel to a dark pixel).  The 
method utilized to form a pixel in passive and active matrix 
displays differs and will be described in later sections.  
Figure 1 illustrates a cross sectional view of a simple TN LC 
display. Figure 2 depicts a dot matrix display as viewed 
without its metal module/case exposing the IC drivers.  
Looking directly at the display the gate or row drivers are 
located either on the left or the right side of the display 
while the data or column drivers are located on the top (and 
or bottom) of the display.  New thin display module technology 
mounts the ICs on conductive tape that allows them to be 
folded behind the display further reducing the size of the 
finished module.  An IC will address a number of rows or 
columns, not just 1 as pictured in figure 2.<p>

Polarizers are an integral part of a LCD display, possessing 
the unique property of only passing light if it is oriented in 
a specific (oriented) direction.  To utilize this 
phenomena in TN LC displays, the bottom polarizer orients 
incoming light in one direction.  The oriented light passes 
through the LC material and is either unaltered or "bent" 90 
degrees.  Depending on the orientation of the top polarizer, 
this light will either pass through or be diffused.  If the 
light is diffused, it will appear as a dark area.  Figure 3 is 
a simple illustration of the sequence of events that occur 
when light passes through a simple twisted nematic LC display.

<strong>1.2 Liquid Crystal Material</strong><p>

<strong>	1.21 Fundamentals</strong><p>

    Please note, I am not a chemist, so I will keep this
section as simple and concise as possible.  Liquid crystals 
encompass a broad group of materials that posses the 
properties of both a solid and a liquid.  More specifically, 
they are a liquid with molecules oriented in one common 
direction (having a long range and repeating pattern-- 
definition of a crystal), but have no long range order in the 
other two directions.  For example, in figure 4 all the lines 
are oriented in the Y direction (up and down), but they posses 
no common ordering in the x direction (disorder is assumed in 
the Z direction).  To more easily visualize this, think of 
figure 4 as one thin slice (one layer of molecules to be 
exact) of a block of material.  If you examined another slice, 
the molecules would still be oriented in the Y direction, but 
they would be in different positions along the X-axis.  By 
stacking millions of these thin slices, the Z direction is 
built up and as a result of the change in relative position on 
the x-axis, the Z direction has no long range order.

<p>
The liquid crystals used for display technology are
thermotropic liquid crystals; they exhibit desired 
characteristics over a specific temperature range.  This is 
the primary reason why LCDs do not operate properly when they 
are too cold or too warm.  If liquid crystals are too cold, 
they will not twist and the display will not form an image.  
If the display is too warm, the resistance of the liquid 
crystal material changes and this alters the properties of the 
display and performance suffers.  Liquid crystal material for 
display use is normally referred to as TN (STN, DSTN, MSTN, 
and etc.) or Twisted Nematic--sometimes known as TNFE or 
Twisted Nematic Field Effect.  It is called TWISTED since the 
crystals are twisted 90 degrees (or more for STN) from the top 
piece of glass to the bottom piece of glass.  (TN usually 
refers only to a 90 degree twist.) Field Effect (a direct 
correlation is the semiconductor MOSFET), refers to the LC 
material's ability to align parallel or perpendicular to an 
applied electric field.  As a result, using twisted or 
untwisted liquid crystal and two polarizers; an applied 
electric field can force the LC material into a particular 
alignment effectively diffusing or passing light through the 
top polarizer.
<p>
As a note of interest, polarizers are also one of the major 
reasons that LC displays require bright back lighting.  The 
polarizers and liquid crystal materials absorb more than 50% 
of the incident light.  As a result, even though the actual
display is a very low power device, the power hungry back
lighting makes a LCD module one of the primary causes of
short battery life in notebook computers.  Due to the fact 
that the LC material has optical properties and effectively 
bends light, the problem of viewing angle effects occur.  When 
the user is not directly in front of the display the image can 
disappear or seem to invert (dark images become light and 
light images become dark).  However, LC material and polarizer 
technology is rapidly improving and that improvement is 
showing up in brighter displays with greater viewing angles.
<p>

<strong>	1.22 Liquid Crystal Alignment</strong><p>

Liquid crystals must be aligned to the top and bottom
pieces of glass in order to obtain the desired twist. In other 
words, the 90 degree twist is formed by anchoring the liquid 
crystal on one glass plate and forcing it to twist across the 
cell gap (the distance between the two glass plates) when 
contacting the second plate.  Furthermore, The actual image 
quality of the display will be dependent on the surface 
alignment of the LC material.  The method currently used for 
aligning liquid crystals was developed by the Dai-Nippon 
Screening (English= Big Japan Screening) Company.  The process 
consists of coating the top and bottom sheets of glass with a 
Polyimide based film. The top piece of glass is coated and 
rubbed in a particular orientation; the bottom panel/polyimide 
is rubbed perpendicular (90 degrees for TN displays) with 
respect to the top panel.  It was discovered that by rubbing 
the polyimide with a cloth, nanometer (1 X 10 - 9 meters) size 
grooves are formed and the liquid crystals align with the 
direction of the grooves.  It is common that when assembling a 
TN LC cell, it will be necessary to eliminate patches of non-
uniform areas.  The two parameters required to eliminate the 
nonuniformities and complete the TN LC display are pretilt 
angle and cholesteric impurities. TN LC cells commonly have 
two problems that affect uniformity following assembly: 
reverse tilt and reverse twist.  Reverse tilt is a function of 
the applied electrical field and reverse twist is common when 
no electrical field is applied.  Reverse twist is eliminated 
by the introduction of cholesteric additives and reverse tilt 
is eliminated by introducing a pre-tilt angle to the LC 
material.  The pre-tilt angle also determines what direction 
the LC molecules will rotate when an electrical field is 
applied.  Pre-tilt angle can be visualized by considering the 
normal position of the LC molecule to be flat against the 
glass plate, by anchoring one edge and forcing the other 
upward by a specific number of degrees, a pretilt angle is 
established.<p>

<strong>	1.23 Liquid Crystal Display Names and classes</strong><p>

Before discussing the different types of LC displays the topic 
of Birefringence must be explained.  When a light ray strikes 
a crystal ( or crystal-like material), it will be split into 
two separate light beams; with one beam perpendicular (offset 
by 90 degrees) from the other.  Since the beams travel 
different paths, they reach the viewer's eyes at slightly 
different times.  This is an essential point, it may cause the 
color or polarity of the display to change when viewed at 
angles where the viewer may see both rays.
<p>
For active matrix displays, in order to maximize contrast
and gray scale reproducibility, Twisted Nematic (TN) is 
utilized.  This material is twisted 90 degrees from the top to 
bottom glass panels.  STN or Super Twisted Nematic is 
chemically distinct from TN and the twist angle is usually 
greater than 200 degrees.  Furthermore, due to the large twist 
angle, the actual alignment of the polarizers for STN LCDs are 
not perpendicular, but  adjusted to find the best direction 
(rotation) for optimum display characteristics.  The STN 
material is rotated in a way so the change from transmission 
to dispersion is very abrupt and therefore can respond quickly 
to small changes in voltage.  Figure 5 illustrates the 
response characteristics of a TN curve and Figure 6 shows the 
response characteristics of a STN curve which will further 
clarify these points.

<strong>	1.24 The TN Liquid Crystal Response Curve</strong><p>

The most prominent feature of the TN response curve is the 
central linear region between the two flat areas (Zone II).  
Zone I describes the white color of the display when no 
electric field is applied.  In other words, the display will 
transmit virtually all the introduced light.  On the other 
hand, in Zone III, the display will diffuse light and appear 
dark.  The middle region can display gray scale or an image
somewhere between White and Black.  The key point here is that 
you must be able to very carefully control the voltage applied 
to the LC cell and maintain it for one duty cycle (before that 
pixel is addressed again) in order to produce accurate colors.  
For this reason, this type of LC material is primarily used 
for active matrix LCDs. <p>

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: because the LC material is 
partially twisted in the gray scale area, when looking at a 
display at an off angle the colors tend to shift and sometimes 
invert due to birefringence.  <p>

COMPUTER APPLICATION NOTE: The TN response curve does not have 
to be utilized for gray scale, in order to make a simpler 
display, improve viewing angle, and use cheaper IC drivers; 
the Apple Powerbook 170's TFTs (thin film transistors) drive 
the TN response curve directly into region 3.  This gives all 
the speed/contrast advantages of a TFT display and cheaper 
manufacturing cost, but provides no gray scale. <p>    

<strong> 1.25 The STN Liquid Crystal Response Curve</strong><p>
 
The Key to understanding the STN curve is simply that due to 
the addressing method applied, only a small amount of voltage 
is available to change the LC material from transmittance to a 
dispersion state. For this reason, the shape of the curve has 
nearly a 90 degree shift between Zone I and Zone II regions; 
in other words, it goes ballistic and nearly straight up !  
This property allows the LC material to shift from white to 
black at its threshold voltage (VT) without being concerned 
with partial transmission (gray scale).  Furthermore, the 90 
Degree curve shape means that gray scale is not available from 
the LC material itself and the driving circuits must provide 
the necessary fixes for levels of gray. 
<p>
STN displays inherently have a yellow on blue appearance 
(anyone remember the old Zenith Laptops ?).  Because many 
individuals found the yellow and blue appearance undesirable, 
a number of techniques were developed to convert the STN image 
to a black on white scheme.  DSTN, developed by Sharp 
Corporation, was the first commercial black and white 
conversion of the STN display and refers to Double Super 
Twisted Nematic.  DSTN displays are actually two distinct STN 
filled glass cells glued together. The first is a LCD display 
as described previously, the second is a glass cell without 
electrodes or polarizers filled with LC material for use as a 
compensator which increases contrast and gives the black on 
white appearance.  The drawbacks are a heavier module, a more 
expensive manufacturing process, and a more powerful 
backlighting system.
<p>
FCSTN is Film Compensated STN and is now the most commonly 
used STN display technology on the market.  FSTN, monochrome 
STN, and Polymer film STN are all standard STN displays with a 
polymer film applied to the glass as a compensation layer 
instead of the second cell as in the case of the DSTN. This 
simpler and more importantly cost effective method provides 
the preferred black on white image for this display 
technology.  However,  once again, this design lowers the 
transmittance of light and requires a more powerful back 
lighting system.  
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE:  Why are STN displays slow ?
Due to the method used to address passive matrix (STN/DSTN)
displays and the high density of pixels required for standard 
VGA displays, the liquid crystal material must respond to an 
extremely small change in voltage.  In developing these 
materials for this voltage characteristic, there was a 
reduction in the switching speed.  A slow display can best be 
illustrated by the tendency of the cursor to "submerge" or 
disappear when rapidly moved across the screen.  Another 
common example is the blurring of images when they quickly 
move across the display as in the case of high speed games.  A 
fast display is less than 40 milliseconds, most STN type 
displays are between 200 and 250 milliseconds.  However, some 
new LC mixtures are reaching 150 millisecond speeds.   
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: What is Contrast ?
Contrast is defined as the ratio of black to white, 
more simply put, how black is black when next to a white or 
clear pixel.   In terms of numbers, passive matrix LCDs are 
usually able to produce a contrast ratio of  approximately 13 
- 20:1; in real terms you get a set of different grays and 
blues but no true blacks.

<strong>	1.3 Liquid Crystal Display Assembly</strong><p>

Once the switching devices or electrodes have been fabricated 
on the glass halves and the polyimide film has been applied & 
rubbed, spacer balls (usually 4 to 8 micrometers [1 X 10 - 6 
meters] in diameter) are sprayed on one half of the display.  
Spacer balls are used to insure that the glass plates remain a 
certain distance apart over the entire area of the display; 
this is also known as cell gap.  If the cell gap is not 
uniform, an image will appear different from one end of the 
display to the other.  If the spacer balls are not applied 
correctly, they will collect and the user will be able see 
them as strange areas of non-uniform dust or distortion.  
(Single spacer balls are too small to see and they are not 
black dots.)  If the Display has a very large cell gap, when 
you apply slight pressure to the display by touching it with 
your finger, you will see the image change and the LC material 
shift under the glass.  Doing this does not damage the 
display, but take care when bringing any sharp objects, such 
as pen or pencils, near the screen; it is very easy to damage 
the polymer film and or polarizers on the display.   
<p>
The two glass panels are then aligned and glued
together with an epoxy.  During panel assembly, if dirt is
trapped between the two glass plates, you most likely will
see these as annoying spots on the display.  During the
application of the glue, one corner is left open. In a vacuum 
chamber, the liquid crystal material
is drawn into the display through the open corner.  Upon 
completion, the remaining hole is filled with another epoxy.
The LC material will align itself to the grooves in the 
polyimide and spread out around the spacer balls.
<p>
After final assembly, excess glass is cut and driver ICs 
are mounted.  The finished display is mounted onto a backlight 
assembly (also known as an inverter assembly) and encased in 
metal.  There are a number of methods for backlighting a LC 
display.  STN displays usually have a side, top, or bottom 
lighting system. In simple terms, this is where the 
fluorescent tube is mounted.  For example, in a side-lit 
display one or two fluorescent tubes will be located at the 
left and or right edges of the display.  A fluorescent tube 
normally 4 mm in diameter is used. This is dispersed by a 
plastic plate around the entire area of the display.  A 
dispersion plate looks like a white sheet with small holes; 
each of the holes provides a small point of light.  On top of 
the dispersion plate, a diffuser is placed.  A diffuser takes 
the numerous points of light and uniformly spreads it out over 
the entire area of the display.  The net effect 
is providing a backlighting source around 4 or 5 mm thick !  
<p>
An Active matrix display, especially color modules, transmit 
much less of the incident light and require more elaborate 
backlighting systems.  An active matrix TFT display has a 
matrix fabricated on one piece of glass; the metal lines and 
transistor elements are not transparent and block a 
significant percentage of light.  In order to obtain higher 
contrast, newer displays incorporate what is called a black 
matrix.  This is a black film that surrounds the pixel 
elements (this can be on the matrix, but is usually around the 
color filters); although this yields higher contrast, it also 
reduces brightness.  Further complicating this, the polarizers 
and the color filters reduce the output to less than 5% of the 
incident light.  As a result, most backlighting systems 
designed for active matrix based displays usually consist of 4 
or 5 four mm tubes placed directly behind the display with a 
diffuser plate to insure uniform irradiation. Therefore, they 
are called backlit. This method of lighting makes the display 
slightly larger, heavier, and greatly increases power 
consumption.  The final metal encased display is called a 
display module or sub-assembly and this is what the end user 
or notebook manufacturer receives.

<h2>LCD FAQ Part II: Addressing and Color Technology (Passive and 
Active Matrix Displays)</h2>

<strong>2.0 General Overview:</strong><p>
 
Addressing describes the method employed to transfer charge 
(data or the display image) from the outside world to the 
display.  Unlike a CRT, which is just a surface of phosphors 
scanned with a beam of electrons in a vacuum, a liquid crystal 
display is an array of conductors with metal (or metal like) 
lines running in both horizontal and vertical directions.  For 
the case of a CRT, the electrons travel through a resistance 
free medium (vacuum) and deliver a clear consistent signal. 
The charge traveling through the metal lines of a LCD matrix 
is affected by the properties of the metal.  As a result, the 
magnitude and waveform of the applied charge can vary from one 
end of the display to the other. This variation imposes 
limitations on display quality and capabilities.
<p>
<strong>2.1 Addressing: Passive and Active Matrix Displays</strong><p>

	There are distinct differences between active and 
passive matrix displays, but two factors make the greatest 
impact on potential customers.  Active matrix displays can 
cost twice as much as an equivalent passive matrix display and 
add more than $1000 to the cost of a notebook form-factor 
computer.  However, active matrix displays produce a stunning 
and bright image without ghosting or artifacts that rivals the 
quality of CRTs.  Furthermore, even with the price 
differential, manufacturers are able to sell every active 
matrix color notebook they can produce.  
<p>
<strong>	2.11 Liquid Crystal Cell Charging</strong><p>
 
	In general terms (regardless of display type), in order 
to protect the liquid crystal material from deteriorating, 
cells are addressed by alternating current (AC), not direct 
current (DC).  There is no resultant charge in the LC material 
following two addressing cycles; build up of charge in the LC 
material will permanently damage it.  In other words, a 
positive and then an equal but opposite negative charge is 
applied to the LC material every other frame.  By applying 
dual polarity addressing, the LC material changes twist 
direction every other cycle and the net charge is zero.  
Furthermore, since the liquid crystal material is changing 
twist directions every other cycle, screen savers or screen 
inverters are not required and in reality do absolutely 
nothing.  Passive matrix displays utilize DIRECT ADDRESSING; 
the charge is applied directly from the drivers to the pixel 
element.  Active matrix displays utilize INDIRECT ADDRESSING; 
the charge is "filtered" through a switch before reaching the 
pixel element.
<p>
<strong>	2.12 Driving Methods: Passive Matrix Displays</strong><p>

	Passive matrix displays have rows of electrodes on one 
half of the display glass and columns of electrodes on the 
other.  The electrodes are usually fabricated out of Indium 
Tin Oxide (ITO), which is a semi-transparent metal oxide.  
When the two pieces of glass are assembled into a display, the 
intersection of a row and column form a pixel element.  
Furthermore, if a pulse is sent down one row and a specific 
column is grounded, the established electric field can change 
the state of liquid crystal(from white to black). By repeating 
this process (display scanning) an image can be formed on the 
display.  Problems arise as the number of rows and columns 
increase. With higher pixel density, the electrode size must 
be reduced and the amount of voltage necessary to drive the 
display rapidly increases.  Furthermore, higher driving 
voltage creates a secondary problem; charging effects. Even 
though only one row and column are selected, the liquid 
crystal material near the row and column being charged are 
affected by the pulse.  The net result is the pixel selected 
is active (dark), but the areas surrounding the addressed 
point are also partially active (grays).  The partially active 
pixels reduce the display contrast and degrade image quality.     
A final problem is the speed of the STN material, a display 
must be able to react in less than 40 milliseconds for 
performance similar to a CRT.  Most STN materials are between 
150 and 250 milliseconds and can not switch from black to a 
white image that quickly.  This problem results in 
disappearing cursors and blurred images when high speed 
graphics are utilized
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: What is STN Gray Scale ?
As discussed in part I section 1.24, the STN curve does not 
possess an intrinsic gray scale capability like the TN curve, 
therefore driving methods have been developed to create the 
illusion of true gray scale.  Gray scale can be derived from 
frame-rate control and dithering/space modulation.  Frame-rate 
control quickly switches on and off a pixel, the eye perceives 
this as gray.  Dithering or space modulation is accomplished 
by alternately keeping some pixels black and some white in a 
checkerboard layout; when using this method, the layout is in 
a random order.  If dithering is in a regular (repeating)  
pattern, it is detectable by the human eye.  In real world 
applications, combinations of both technologies are applied to 
commercial displays.  The result, however, is sometimes wavy 
or moving grays.  ( The image appears to be moving in waves or 
a solid color appears to be in motion when a large area is set 
to a specific gray level.) 
<p>
RECENT TECHNOLOGY NOTE: What are Dual Scan STN Displays ?
This is simply taking currently made color STN displays and 
applying some previously developed technology.  Back in the 
late 1970's and early 1980's liquid crystal chemistry was not 
as advanced and in order to build high data content displays, 
manufacturers were forced to build two displays on one glass 
plate.  A dual scan display utilizes similar technology.  
Instead of running the columns down the entire display, they 
are terminated in the center of the display, a small gap is 
left, and the line is continued to the bottom of the display.  
In reality, you now have two 640 X 240 displays on one glass 
plate.  Therefore, if IC drivers are mounted on the top and 
the bottom of the display, the charge must only travel half 
the distance of a normal display.  As a result, the effects of 
the contrast limitations discussed in section 2.12 can be 
reduced.  The end result appears to be a brighter display, but 
in reality it is  only improved contrast (the blacks appear 
darker).  The dual scan STN display still suffers from the 
ghosting and artifact problems inherent in all slow STN 
displays.
<p>
<strong>	2.13 Driving Methods: Active Matrix Displays</strong><p>

	In order to eliminate the problems of the STN/passive 
matrix display, the active matrix display was developed.  
Active matrix displays have a thin film Transistor or diode on 
the glass substrate that indirectly addresses each pixel 
element.  Depending on the display type, application, or 
manufacturer, the TFT may be comprised of amorphous silicon 
(a-Si) or polycrystalline silicon (p-Si),  The TFT  completely 
isolates one pixel element from the others in the display and 
eliminates the problem of partially active pixels.  Simply 
put, the TFT acts as a switch ! When a row of TFTs are 
addressed the gate lines are active-- the switch is turned on, 
this allows charge to flow from the columns into the pixels 
and set the image for the frame cycle.  Once a row has been 
addressed, the gate line is reversed biased (the switch is 
turned off) to insure that no charge can pass from the columns 
into the pixel element.  Thus, the pixel is now completely 
isolated as the rest of the display is addressed. The LC 
material acts as a capacitor and stores charge.  After a 
charge is placed on a liquid crystal cell ( the defined pixel 
area), it begins draining similar to a discharging capacitor 
(an exponential function).  As a result,  unless the display 
can be written quickly (all 480 rows scanned and the return to 
the top of the display to rescan starting from row 1 for a VGA 
display) the image will not be uniform from the top to the 
bottom of the display as the LC material starts to untwist.
In order to insure charge storage for one frame and carefully 
control charge on a pixel element, TFT displays incorporate a 
second capacitor in parallel with the LC material. The 
combined capacitance gives active matrix displays the 
essential capability to accurately maintain the amount of 
charge applied; thus reliable partial charges can be utilized 
and gray scale or full color displays are possible.  With 
proper drivers and high quality TFTs, 256 gray scales have 
been obtained with quality that surpasses that of CRTs.  TN 
material can also switch much faster than STN, thus 40 
millisecond TFT displays are common yielding CRT like speed.  
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: What is cross Talk ?  Cross talk 
is best described as the effect when a dark image (box or 
widow shape) is placed in the middle of a white background.  
Faint vertical and horizontal lines will be seen from the edge 
of the window proceeding to the edges of the screen.  This can 
be caused by poorly designed drivers or poorly made TFTs.  The 
off selected TFTs are not completely off and some charge, very 
strong at the edge of a window, has leaked into the pixels 
creating the effect.  This is a common problem and is being 
addressed by the manufacturers of TFT based displays.
<p>
<strong>2.2 Color Display Pixel Layout and Yields</strong><p> 

In order to build a fully functional color VGA display, a TFT 
LCD must have 480 X 640 X 3 pixel elements.  The 640 X 480 is 
the well understood VGA pixel layout (640 X 400 for the Apple 
Powerbook series and 640 X 480 for the 180c), except 640 red, 
640 green, and 640 blue columns or stripes of color pixels are 
now required.  This is a total of 921,600 TFTs that must work 
in order to build a perfect display.  Using a semiconductor 
analogy, it is similar to building a 1 Megabit DRAM on a 10 
inch glass plate; not an easy task considering a particle 
smaller than the diameter of the human hair can destroy a 
single TFT.  Achieving a 100 % yield or a perfect display is 
virtually impossible, thus even though manufacturer yields are 
starting to reach 60% (for sellable devices) prices are very 
high.  Furthermore, if 4 defective pixels are found on a color 
VGA screen, this already represents a 99.99 % pixel yield-- 
not bad for any process.  For the most part, the most common 
pixel defect is caused by some form of contamination damaging 
a TFT and preventing it from turning the pixel off (seen as 
bright spots on a dark background).  There are two layouts for 
pixels on TFT displays.  The most common for computer 
applications is the STRIPE layout.  A stripe layout has 
repeating stripes of red, green, and blue columns across the 
display.  For multimedia and high density arrays (projection 
LCD modules), a triad pixel layout is used.  A triad layout 
has the three color sub-pixels in a triangle shape.  Figure 7 
illustrates the difference between the two layouts.
<pre>

Stripe Layout				Triad Layout

Note: What is a color filter ?  A color filter works by 
absorbing specific wavelengths of light and only passing light 
of a certain wavelengths (In other words, a red filter will 
remove all wavelengths of light except for red -- thus it 
looks red !).  White light is made up of a spectrum of 
wavelengths, so it can yield the red, green, and blue for 
displays.  However, when filtering out the unwanted 
wavelengths, the overall brightness is reduced.
</pre>
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: What is a pixel ?
Unfortunately, in most of the literature and magazines, there 
is not a clear definition as to what a pixel is.  In its most 
basic form, a pixel is described as one element on a display 
screen.  For a monochrome screen this is an adequate 
description.  However a color pixel is actually made up of 
three subpixels:  a red, green, and blue pixel.  This is 
sometimes called a pixel triad.  Therefore care must be taken 
in describing pixels.  In terms of this document, a pixel is 
the entire element consisting of red, green, and blue sub-
elements.  A subpixel consists of the individual red, green, 
or blue elements.  Gray scales for LC displays are always 
calculated as a function of subpixels.  
<p>
<strong>2.3 Color Displays: Gray Scales and Bits </strong><p>

	Due to the overall poor performance of Passive Matrix 
color displays, only active matrix displays will be 
specifically discussed. However, major points are applicable 
to both display addressing technologies.  Unlike an analog 
CRT, in a digital color TFT active matrix display, you 
literally get what you buy...forever.  Even if you upgrade to 
a new video driver or display card, you will still have the 
same number of colors and gray scales.  The number of colors 
is a direct result of the number of gray scales a display can 
reproduce.  The standard VGA format is rated to display 256 
colors, however it can select from a 18 BIT CLUT (color look 
up table)  which means the choice of 262,144 colors(this 
calculation is based on a bit calculation for a pixel triad -- 
2 ^ 18 --- see later section on calculations).  Intrinsic gray 
scale reproducibility for TFT displays is a result of two 
factors: the quality of the driver ICs used on the display and 
the resistance of the gate metal(the rows of the display).  
The gate metal must carry a clear and undeformed pulse from 
one end of the display to the other( 640 X 3 = 19200 lines).  
If the pulse is not maintained the TN curve will not charge to 
the desired level and the correct color can not be displayed.  
Therefore, the more gray scales required, the greater the 
control that must be exerted over the gate lines.  For 
example, most displays sold today can display 256 colors out 
of 4092 or 512.  The 256 colors is based on the VGA video 
controller, the 4092 is a display limitation.  4092 possible 
colors indicates that a display can reproduce 16 gray scales.  
This is derived from 16 (red) X 16 (blue) X 16 (green) = 4092 
possible colors.  Once again, dithering can be used to extend 
this, but there are displays in limited production that can 
reproduce 256 gray scales or more than 16 million colors !  
Most current TFT color displays feature 3 bit drivers (where 2 
raised to the third power yields 8); these drivers can produce 
a total of 512 colors.  This is more than adequate unless 
later on you decide you wish to pursue some multimedia 
functions which require more than 32 levels of gray scale.  
Although the controller and the computer may be fast enough to 
handle the functions, 8 or 16 gray scales will be inadequate-- 
your image will not be what you expect (It will look like a 
collection of color shadows).  Sharp has recently demonstrated 
10 inch 640 X 480 displays running on Apple Macintoshes 
displaying 64 gray scales.  These 6 bit drivers are supposedly 
entering production and will enter the commercial market 
shortly.  The color reproduction of these displays is 
excellent.
<p>
<strong>2.4 Understanding Digital Color Pixels </strong><p>

	4 Bits, 8 Bits, 16 Bits, 24 Bits Just how many colors 
can they actually generate ?  Digital video divides the number 
of colors or gray scales into a distinct number of points.  
Based on these "POINTS" the system can generate a fixed number 
of colors or gray scales.  Manufacturers tend to play games 
with numbers, so sometimes it is very difficult to understand 
"BIT" color talk.  First of all, the bit system is based on 
the binary system so: 1 Bit color, which is 2 raised to the 
first power is 2.  In other words a black & white display 
where the pixel has a state of being either on or off.  This 
can currently be extended to 24 bits which (at 2 to the 24 
power) yields more than 16 million gray scales.  OK, now that 
we understand how gray scales are calculated, lets convert 
this to a color display: Once again, manufacturers play a game 
with numbers and here we introduce bpp or BITS PER PIXEL.  Now 
depending on manufacturer, a pixel can be made up of 1 
subpixel (the individual Red, Green, and Blue pixels) or can 
be a composite of all three colors.  If we examine a 16bpp 
system the following calculations are applicable:  2 raised to 
the 16th power is: 65536.  So if the system is 16 bpp for the 
combined primary colors, the system can produce a total of 
65536 colors.  If the system produces 16 bpp for all three 
colors then 65536 X 65536 X 65536 = 2.8 X 10^14 colors.  The 
small table below summarizes the Bits confusion.   Triad Pixel 
refers to a combination of the RED/GREEN/BLUE pixels.  
Subpixel refers to the individual red, green, or blue pixel.  
The number of gray scales for a monochrome display is always 
the same as a triad calculation bpp display. The numbers 
listed down the columns refer to how many gray scales or 
colors that a system configuration can produce.  CRT based 
color is usually calculated as the triad pixel calculation.

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE:   What is analog video ?  Unlike 
digital or bit based video analog video is based on a 
continuous flow of data.  The wave form can be thought of as a 
continuous wave of points with the distance between points so 
small that it is impossible to differentiate between them.  In 
other words, it can theoretically provide an infinite number 
of gray scales.  VGA is an analog system and VGA CRTs are 
analog displays.  The advantage of an analog display is that 
when you upgrade your video card and drivers to handle more 
colors, your existing monitor should be able to operate with 
the extended color ranges.  NEC makes an analog XVGA TFT LCD, 
but due to power handling requirements, it is not suitable for 
battery based portable computers.
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: Why are TFT Color Displays 
Expensive ?  There are numerous reasons for this.  As 
discussed above, displays with large numbers of defective 
pixels can not be sold and as a result, yield is usually 
thought to be the major problem.  In reality, one should be 
aware that the largest cost of TFT displays are the materials 
utilized for production.  Since Japanese manufacturers have 
not standardized the size of displays yet, each manufacturer 
has specific material needs (glass, holders for machines, 
robots, and etc.).  This fact alone keeps display prices 
extremely high since material and machine suppliers can not 
make standard parts for an entire industry at this time. 
<p>
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION NOTE: How many gray scales are 
required for multimedia operations ?  Usually 64 gray scales 
or more are required for true multimedia operations.  TFT LCDs 
with 64 gray scales will probably be available in volume 
within a year.  
<p>
COMMENT: Why are some color TFT displays much brighter than 
others  ?  The brightness of a screen is determined by two 
related factors; the size of the screen and the aperture ratio 
of the pixels.  On the surface of an active matrix array 
there are both pixels and electronics, as a result of the 
opaque electronics, some of the area that light could pass 
through is blocked.  The ratio of light passing through the 
pixel to the entire area of the pixel and associated 
electronics is called the aperture ratio.  The larger the 
ratio is, the more light that can pass through the pixel and 
the brighter the image on the display will be.  Furthermore, 
if the display itself is bigger, there is more room for the 
pixels and the result is more light passing through the 
individual pixels.  For this reason, DTIs 10 inch display 
found in the IBM Thinkpad 700c is much brighter than some of 
the smaller 8.4 and 9.5 inch TFT displays.
<p>
<strong>2.4 Basic Principles of TFT Operation</strong> <p>
 
	For all intensive purposes, a TFT can simply be 
considered a switch; when selected (on) it allows charge to 
flow through it and when off it acts as an barrier preventing 
or at least restricting the flow of charge.  As mentioned 
earlier, a TFT is a MOS FET device or a Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor.  The gate line can be 
considered the "switch" of the transistor, with this you turn 
it on, partially on, or off.  The Source and drain are the 
entrance and exit, respectively, for the charge you want to 
pass through the switch.  In the case of a display, this is 
the charge that you want to appear on the pixel.  Looking at 
Figure 7, source and drain metal electrodes are separated by 
an amorphous silicon (a-Si) semiconductor layer; with the 
absence of charge the a-Si layer acts as an insulator or 
resistor and prevents the flow of charge from the source to 
drain; thus isolating the pixel from the rest of the display.  
SiNx or silicon Nitride is the gate insulator and forms the 
gate dielectric; electrons do not pass from the gate line into 
the transistor, but are used to influence the charge 
distribution in the semiconductor layer.  A MOS FET that fits 
this description (you turn it on)is called an enhancement 
device.  When a positive charge is placed on the gate line, 
electrons (or negatively charged particles) will begin to 
collect in the area above the gate, on the other side of the 
Silicon Nitride (SiNx) in the a-Si.  When the charge on the 
gate is increased to a certain point, called the VT or 
threshold voltage, enough electrons will have collected in the 
a-Si to change it from an insulator to a conductor.  In other 
words, you build up a channel of electrons, so if there are 
electrons at the source (high) and nothing at the drain (low), 
the electrons will begin to move through the electron filled 
channel until the charge is the same at both sides or you turn 
the transistor off.  The result is a charging of the pixel and 
a change in the state of the liquid crystals.  The unique 
aspect of this device is the nonlinear characteristics after 
the TFT passes through Vt.  It exponentially moves to a 
conduction state (usually 6 to 8 orders of magnitude) and 
makes it very easy to turn a TFT on or off around the Vt 
value.  For more information on MOS FET device operation, pick 
up a book on Semiconductor Physics or Solid State Physics.  
The above is only meant as a basic simplified description of 
MOS device operation. 
<p>

<strong>2.5 TFT Connections</strong><p>

	The gate line of the TFT determines whether or not the 
TFT will pass a charge into the pixel.  These are controlled 
by the row bus-lines.  On a standard VGA display, the gate 
lines would be the 480 horizontal lines.  The source lines of 
the TFT are connected to the column or data bus-lines.  These 
lines provide the charge for the pixel or contain the data for 
the image.  The drain lines of the TFT are directly attached 
to the ITO pixel, this transfers the charge from the 
semiconductor region into the pixel.  <p>
