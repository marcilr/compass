The digital compass is interrupt driven. The AT89C52 microcontroller has 
several vectored interrupt handlers
that process routine events. One thing that confused me when I
was first writing interrupt routines was how to ensure that
resources, like the circular buffers, are not accessed simultaneous 
by different routines. This sounds simple and the solution pretty easy.  
The trick is to use mutexes, single bit flags that indicate a resource
is being used. In this way routines can set a mutex bit to lock a resource
so the interrupt handlers know that a particular resource is in use and should return
control to the main program before trying to process the interrupt. 
Timer0 is used to generate an interrupt every 50ms
that sets flags to initiate an A/D conversion and draw the compass
needle in the main event loop. The serial inturrupt is initiates whenever
data is received or sent from the serial port. This interrupt accesses 
two circular buffers (incoming and outgoing) and ensures serial data is 
processed according.  This includes passing commmands to the central 
dispatcher as well controlling two circular buffers for incoming and
outgoing characters. The serial interrupt handler was one of the more difficult
routines to write for the compass. The final inturrupt the compass uses 
is External Interrupt 0.  This is an external pin on the microcontroller that 
is used by the A/D converters to signal that calibration or a conversion has 
been completed.  Below is a list of the interrupts and associated assembly
code:

          - Flowchart that illustrates the serial inturrupt handler, also
          shows the use of the mutexes I described previously.

The following example shows a very simple serial inturrupt handler.
The handler is called whenever the RI (Receive character) or TI (Transmit 
charcter) interrupt flags are set. This example echos received characters
and clears the inturrupt flags as needed.  From this example it is possible
to add code to put/get the characters from buffers and process special keys
like carriage return, esc, etc. Needless to say the compass serial inturrupt
handler is a bit more complex than this one.

; It assumes that the serial port has been initialized,
