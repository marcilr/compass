  In the perfect environment the HMC2003 magnetic sensor would not be
  affected by outside sources.  However the steel protoboard on which
  the sensor resides and circuitry affect the output of the sensor.
  Per the Honeywell application note Applications of Magnetoresitive
  Sensors in Navigation Systems.[1]  I was able to compensate for the
  affects of the ferrous protoboard and circuitry.
