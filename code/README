  In the perfect environment the HMC2003 magnetic sensor would not be
  affected by outside sources.  However the steel protoboard on which
  the sensor resides and circuitry affect the output of the sensor.
  Per the Honeywell application note Applications of Magnetoresitive
  Sensors in Navigation Systems.[1]  I was able to compensate for the
  affects of the ferrous protoboard and circuitry.

  In some applications which require incoming data to be processed serially and data may come
  in before the microcontroller can devote the cycles to processing it, the incoming data has
  to be "buffered" (saved) for some period of time.  Ideally, the algorithms used for saving
  and retrieving this data, as well as maintaining the buffer should be as simple and fast
  executing as possible.  Like most problems, there are many ways of solving it, with one of
  the best being the "circular buffer".

  A circular buffer is a memory area that has been set aside for an index to store data and
  another index to retrieve the data.  Once an index has reached the end of the buffer, it
  is reset to the start of the buffer.  In this way, the buffer is "circular" in that it
  never ends.
