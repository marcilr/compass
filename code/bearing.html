    In the perfect environment the HMC2003 magnetic sensor would
    not be affected by outside sources.  However the steel
    protoboard on which the sensor resides and circuitry 
    affect the output of the sensor.  Per the Honeywell
    application note 
    <A HREF="pdf/sae.pdf">Applications of Magnetoresitive
    Sensors in Navigation Systems</A>. I was able to
    compensate for the affects of the ferrous protoboard and
    circuitry.
    </P>

    In order to get an accurate bearings, scale and offset factors
    for the X and Y sensor readings must be established. The procedure
    is as follows:
    </P>
    
    1. Find maximum and minimum values for X and Y magnetic 
    readings. With a bit of testing in the back yard away
    from other ferrous sources I derived the following values:
    
<DIR>
<PRE>
Xmin=-5064   Xmax=3948
Ymin=-1277   Ymax=6683
</PRE>
</DIR>
    
    2. Using these four values determine the X and Y scale
    factors (Xsf,Ysf):

<DIR>  
<PRE>
Xsf = 1 or (Ymax-Ymin)/(Xmax-Xmin)
        whichever is greater
           
Ysf = 1 or (Xmax-Xmin)/(Ymax-Ymin)
        whichever is greater
    
Hence:

Xsf = (6683-(-1277))/(3948-(-5064))
	 = (7960/9012)
	 = .8833 this result is less than one so,
Xsf = 1

Ysf = (3948-(-5064))/(6683-(-1277))
    = 9012/7960
Ysf = 1.1322

</PRE>
</DIR>

   <P>
   3. Calculate offset correction values (Xoff,Yoff):
   </P>

<DIR>
<PRE>
Xoff = [(Xmax-Xmin)/2-Xmax]*Xsf
     = [(3948-(-5064))/2-3948]*1
Xoff = 558

Yoff = [(Ymax-Ymin)/2-Ymax]*Ysf
     = [(6683-(-1277))/2-6638]*1.1322
Yoff = -3060
</PRE>
</DIR>

    <P>
    4. The (Xsf,Ysf) and (Xoff,Yoff) values are applied to
    the (x,y) readindings from the AD converters as follows:
    </P>

<DIR>
<PRE>
Xvalue=Xsf*Xreading+Xoff
Yvalue=Ysf*Yreading+Yoff
</PRE>
</DIR>

	<P>
	5. Once the (Xvalue,Yvalue) have been calculated a 
	bearing to magnetic north can be found using arctangent:
	</P>
<DIR>
<PRE>
Azimuth=atan(Xvalue,Yvalue)
</PRE>
</DIR>
	
	<P>
	6. Finally the magnetic deviation, about 27.5&deg; for
	Anchorage is added to the Azimuth to get the final reading.
	</P>
