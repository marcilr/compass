  The Birth of CORDIC

  Abstract. The very earliest history of the CORDIC computing technique - a highly efficient
  method to compute elementary functions - is presented.  The CORDIC technique was born out
  of necessity, the incentive being the replacement of the analog navigation computer of the
  B-58 aircraft by a high accuracy, high-performance digital computer.  The revolutionary
  development of the CORDIC technique is presented, along with details of the very first
  implementations: the CORDIC I prototype and the CORDIC II airborne digital navigation
  computer.

  Jack Volder Jack volder served an a B-24 flight engineer during World War II.  After his
  discharge, he enrolled in Texas Technological College where he received his Bachelor of
  Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1949...

  (Received ASAP '97 Best Paper Award)

  In this contribution we present practical techniques for implementing Givens rotations
  based on the well-known CORDIC algorithm.  Rotations are the basic operation in many
  high performance adaptive filltering schemes as well as numerous other advanced signal
  processing algorithms relying on matrix decompositions.
