  (Received ASAP '97 Best Paper Award)

  In this contribution we present practical techniques for implementing Givens rotations
  based on the well-known CORDIC algorithm.  Rotations are the basic operation in many
  high performance adaptive filltering schemes as well as numerous other advanced signal
  processing algorithms relying on matrix decompositions.
